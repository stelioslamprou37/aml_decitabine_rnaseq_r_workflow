task: >
  You have been given bulk RNA-seq FASTQs from HL-60 cells (Homo sapiens) treated with decitabine (DAC) vs DMSO.
  Using the provided FastQs and the workflow (Salmon → tximport → DESeq2), answer the following.

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: subsampling_qc
    text: "How many fragments does Salmon report as 'num_processed' for sample DMSO_rep1? (After subsampling to 50,000 paired fragments.)"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: quantification
    text: "How many genes have non-zero counts in at least one sample after tximport summarization?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: differential_expression
    text: "How many genes are significantly upregulated in DAC vs DMSO at FDR < 0.1 and |log2FC| >= 1?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: differential_expression
    text: "Provide the ordered list (highest to lowest) of the top 3 upregulated genes by log2 fold-change (DAC vs DMSO), breaking ties by adjusted p-value."
    answer_type: ordered_list

  - id: q5
    stage: differential_expression
    text: "Provide the unordered set of the top 5 downregulated genes by log2 fold-change (DAC vs DMSO)."
    answer_type: set_unordered
